We here at Team 12 present to you our first project! Plague Doctor, The Price of our Sins. You may be wondering, what is the concept of the game? The game is a Top-Down 2D game which contains a rich backstory to allow you the player to understand why not only your player but others are in the current situation, but also to find out the deeper mystery behind the city you are exploring. The game having the mechanic of being able to find the mystery behind the game is a mechanic which will entice you not to only continue playing the game but also finish the game.
