4. In URL type this: https://github.com/DankusMemeus/Team12IsTheBest/
5. Enter your GitHub Username and Password in the Authentication section.
6. Import all branches for now
7. Set the directory to where ever you want, this would be your local version of the program.

10. Click Finish and the code will be there for you to work on.
