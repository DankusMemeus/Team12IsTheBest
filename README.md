## Introduction? <a name = "introduction"></a>

We here at Team 12 present to you our first project! Plague Doctor, The Price of our Sins. You may be wondering, what is the concept of the game? The game is a Top-Down 2D game which contains a rich backstory to allow you the player to understand why not only your player but others are in the current situation, but also to find out the deeper mystery behind the city you are exploring. The game having the mechanic of being able to find the mystery behind the game is a mechanic which will entice you not to only continue playing the game but also finish the game. 

## What is the story about? <a name = "story"></a>

Our game is set in a dystopian future where society has collapsed due to global warming, overpopulation, pollution, and war. The land has been over-farmed, making it a barren wasteland where almost nothing can grow, life is sparse, and our species regressed into a pre-industrial state with the survivors living in remote villages surrounded by relics of the past. The disease is common and widespread, with no real cure or healthcare the people must turn to the Order, a mysterious group of individuals who have access to technology with which they can create antibiotics to combat illnesses. 

The player's character is a Plague Doctor from the Order who has been sent to a city in order to cure an outbreak of a disease. The city is the entire game's setting. Throughout the game, as the player makes progress towards controlling the disease, they will discover information about their Order, how they've managed to create a cure, and the origin of the illnesses plaguing humanity. 

The game will have multiple endings, depending on how the player went about the game. One will be for those who healed a lot of the town. Another for those who euthanised a lot of the villagers and a final one if the town is overrun with the disease. Whether the player discovered the secrets of the story would also be featured in the ending.
