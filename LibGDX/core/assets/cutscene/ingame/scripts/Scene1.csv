templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You walk to town hall into Sylvias office and finds her journal. You begin to read through journal.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 1,7th April : I have just arrived in the town. There is a very murky atmosphere here. Everything is very dark and eerie almost chilling to be here. I have feeling this will not end well.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 2,13th June : This plague is worse than I thought it might be. I have tried everything in my power to get rid of it but it just will not go! I need to find a better way to attack this.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 3,19th September : Something must be going on; things are not what they appear to be in this town. The plague is not behaving normally. There seems to be a lot I am unaware of The Order may be keeping things from me. The suffering that these poor civilians are having to go through can be stopped. I need to investigate
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 4,28th November : I am starting to see things. A couple of colleagues from The Order. I might need to check my mask for leaks. . .
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You gets interrupted while reading journal as overseer walks in on him.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Aah I see you are becoming acquainted with your new office.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Hello I am the new Doctor assigned to you by The Order
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,We were expecting you to visit sooner after the previous Doctor disappeared.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,I was told a bit about this already. We think it was a mask leak.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Look I do not care if she sprouted wings called herself a bird and fucked off South with the rest of those feathered bastard.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,I just want the best for this town
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,I am sick of the damage this plague is causing. Finish the job and go. I do not want trouble in this town.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Doctor,Protocol states . . . Oh . . . he is gone.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Objective,Inspect a house!.
