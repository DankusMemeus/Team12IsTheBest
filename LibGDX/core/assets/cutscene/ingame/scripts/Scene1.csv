templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You walk to the town hall and into what looks like the office of the previous Doctor. On a table by the window you find a small leather book. You begin to read through it.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 1,7th April : I have just arrived in the town. There is a very murky atmosphere here. The residents seem very distrusting and angry. I have a feeling this will not end well.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 2,13th June : This plague is worse than I initially thought. I have tried everything in my power to get rid of it but it just will not go! I need to find a better way to attack this.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 3,19th September : Something must be going on; things are not what they appear to be in this town. The plague is behaving abnormally. There seems to be a lot I am unaware of. The Order has been telling me not to worry. No wonder the people here are so depressed if this is what they have been dealing with. I need to investigate further.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Page 4,"28th November : I'm starting to see things. Namely a couple of colleagues from the capital. I might need to check my mask for leaks, the last thing I need right now is to get infected."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You get interrupted just as you finish the last page when a portly man walks in on you and loudly clears his throat.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,"Aah I see you are becoming acquainted with your new office, nice of you to drop in and say hi."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Hello I am the new Doctor assigned to your village.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,"We were expecting you to visit a lot sooner, the last quack disappeared ages ago."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,I was briefed on the situation here already.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,"For all anyone knows she sprouted wings, called herself a bird and fucked off South with the rest of those feathered bastards."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,"I'm just here to do my job and cure this plague, not go chasing after missing colleagues."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Get on with it then! I am sick of the damage this plague is causing. Finish the job and get out of here. I do not want to deal with more of your kind.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Doctor,Protocol states that when my work is fin- Oh... he's gone.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Objective,Inspect a house.
