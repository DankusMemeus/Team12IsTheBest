0,Order,Doctor report your findings.
0,Plague Doctor,I found the man you sent to keep infecting the town. He will not be doing so anymore.
0,Order,Ah yes an unfortunate outcome. Why did you do it?
0,Plague Doctor,You sent me here to do a job and he was actively working against that goal.
0,Order,Of course and what if we were to change the mission objective? What if we were to ask you to let roughly 40 Percent of the population... die of natural causes?
0,Plague Doctor,To what end why are you people doing this?
0,Order,Do you know why we have to live the way we do? Why we are not still living in those huge buildings with no food shortage and technology by our side?
0,Order,Because the old civilization could not do basic maths. Our planet is finite its resources finite it cannot sustain the exponential population growth of humans.
0,Order,They never understood that but we do. Now we have even fewer resources and subsequently we can support fewer people.
0,Order,When settlements start to get out of hand we send in a disease of some sort to keep their population in check.
0,Order,That is how we will survive. It is the only way. Now doctor do your job. 40 Percent population reduction. Over and out.
