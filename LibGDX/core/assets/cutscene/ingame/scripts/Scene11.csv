0,Doctor,"I know you said you are not interested in my findings but this needs to be shared. Gather everyone in here. Now."
0,Overseer,What are you babbling on about? What happened? Have you finally gone mad like the other doctor? Cause you are starting to sound a lot like her.
0,Doctor,Maybe you were right not to trust the Order gather everyone in.
0,Overseer,Hmph. If you are wasting our time you are outta here.
0,Narrator,Plague Doctor meets with residents to tell the about the truth.
0,Doctor,Evening everyone some of you might not recognize me. I am the Doctor sent by The Order to get rid of the plague that has infested this town. I have gathered you here to tell you about the origin of this plague.
0,Random Resident,What are you telling us? My wife and kids are dead and you are organizing a town gatherings?!
0,Doctor,I understand these are tiring times but you need to calm down! What I am about to tell you will change everything. This plague has not occurred naturally. I have reason to believe that the Order has been infecting this and possibly other villages.
0,Villager,Why would they do such a thing? You are just trying to cover your incompetence and that other bitches.
0,Sylvia,He is not. It is true. Fellow towns folk-
0,Villager,Wha!? Where did you come from it is true what they say where there is one cockroach there is a whole load more.
0,Sylvia,I discovered the same thing Adam here did a few weeks ago and I have been working towards a plan to bring the Order down since then.
0,Sylvia,I apologize for not doing more to help you but I have been in hiding. Please stay calm we will not let them kill any more people.
0,Overseer,What do you think you are doing? Disappearing in the middle of a pandemic and then trotting back in here like hot shit! Why should any of us listen to what you have to say?
0,Sylvia,I know we never saw eye to eye however since I was assigned to work in M-Attan I have worked as hard as I could to ensure the least number of deaths.
0,Sylvia,I understand it may be hard to swallow but the Order has really been spreading the plague. I did not want to believe it at first but the evidence is irrefutable.
0,Overseer,And what do you think this will change? We are still dying! Every day you were gone more people died!
0,Overseer,I do not much care for the Order but before you two they at least sent competent people to do their jobs and keep us healthy.
0,Overseer,You disappeared when we needed you most and now you expect us to just forget and do what? Stage a revolt against the only people who still have old world technology?
0,Sylvia,I expect you to understand the situation and help me prevent any more unnecessary deaths.
0,Overseer,And why would the Order even infect us before this damn plague our village was booming more hands to help with fishing and we could feed three settlements only using our produce.
0,Sylvia,I don . . . Wait did you say your population was booming? That . . . That may just be it.
0,Overseer,What do you mean?
0,Sylvia,When you plant too many plants in your gardens what happens?
0,Overseer,They start dying. Some have to be removed.
0,Doctor,Population control . . .
0,Villager,We are not plants. They cannot treat us like that!
0,Sylvia,They must not want us to end up like the first civilization.
0,Overseer,I . . . I need to tell the other settlements. I will radio in. Looks like we may be staging a raid after all.
0,Sylvia,Hold on now this may be too rash. I have been trying to formulate a good plan for weeks if you give me-
0,Overseer,No! The longer we let those bastards do whatever the hell they want the more people die! Soulless disgusting pigs. Martha and Lily died for nothing.
0,Doctor,Who-
0,Overseer,I am informing the other villages and that is final! You are welcome to try and stop me but I do not think you can stop all of us.
0,Doctor,Let us at least think this t- Agh wait stop!
0,Villager,Do not you try it quack! We will not let you stop him!
0,Sylvia,It is pointless. Let's get out of here we can discuss this later with him. For now we need to focus on saving the remaining people.
0,Doctor,What will you be doing? I saw your broken gear in the abandoned hut.
0,Sylvia,They are going to need someone to help them formulate a plan. I reckon an ex Doctor might be able to help out. I have visited pretty much all of the capital so I can offer a lot of help.
