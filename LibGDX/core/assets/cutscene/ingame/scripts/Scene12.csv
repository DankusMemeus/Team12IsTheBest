templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,So now you know. This is why I disappeared.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Not as exciting as insanity.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,But more understandable. What do you plan to do with this information?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Not sure . . .  I think . . . I think I need some time to process all of this. Finding out what the Order has been doing is a bit of a shock. Why would they do this do they not want us to recover our population?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,Evidently not. I have been trying to figure out why they are doing it and how to stop them since I disappeared. So far I do not have much past cure everyone in M-Attan and move on to different villages gathering supporters in secret.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Right. So can I count on your help in curing this plague again?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,I am afraid Alexander the man who worked here found it and destroyed it. Getting some more would be a dangerous affair so I plan on using my time to come up with a plan against the Order.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,Now that I am not being followed by these lunatics I should be able to come up with something concrete a lot faster.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Let me know what you come up with. I Will make myself useful and go back into town to heal some more people hopefully there will not be any more disturbances.
