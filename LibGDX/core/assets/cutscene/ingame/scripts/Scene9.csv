templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Maybe you are more incompetent than I gave you credit for. I just heard from old Milly up the road that her husbands has fallen ill again.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,I suppose you'll need to stay here for now. But as soon as this mess is over I expect to hear a different voice from behind that mask.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,What? Ill again? I cured all the villagers unless... Unless it has mutated.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Or possibly it incubated in the man before and he has only gotten the symptoms now...
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Not my job to know why. All I know is that you have more work to do.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,So you better get out there and finish the job though I understand you may lack of experience with that...
