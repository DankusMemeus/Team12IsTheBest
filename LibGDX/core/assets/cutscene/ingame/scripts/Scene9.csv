templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Maybe you are incompetent than I gave you credit for. I just heard from old Milly up the road that her husbands has fallen ill again.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,I suppose you will be staying here for now. As soon as this mess is over I expect to hear a different voice behind that mask.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,What? Ill again? I cured all the villagers unless . . . Unless it is mutated.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Or possibly it incubated in the man before and he has only gotten the symptoms now.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,Not my job to know why. All I know is that you have more work to do.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Overseer,So you better get out there and finish the job though I understand you may lack of experience with that . . .
