templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Badge,Dr S.W. Infectious Disease Physician.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You contact The Order.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,This is Doctor No. 0453 reporting. I have arrived in M-Attan.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,The Order,Good to hear you've made it safely to your destination. Anything to report?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,I have found some belongings of a Dr S.W. Is that the missing doctor?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,The Order,Dr Sylvia Wong was posted there before you. We think her mask may have been punctured and she could've gotten infected. She began behaving very strangely before going AWOL. We have had no contact with her since then.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,I see. What do you want me to do about her situation?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,The Order,See if you can find out what happened but remember your primary objective is curing the residents of M-Attan. Report all findings to us immediately. Remember that she may have lost her mind if she is even still alive. If all you find is a corpse, then at least bring back her gear. Other than that I assume you remember what to do?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Objective,Find 6 notes.
