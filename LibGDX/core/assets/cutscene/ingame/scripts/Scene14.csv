templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Order,Well done Adam. We have heard of your success in bringing down the population through the overseers report.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Order,"We assume you know it is time to cure the rest of the population. We cannot afford to kill more balance must be kept."
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Order,Afterwards we will talk about a promotion for you. We are glad you have the logic to follow our way of thinking. What of Sylvia any news?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,She has been working on a way to bring the Order down from the shadows. I have not been able to follow her tracks and take care of her.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Order,Do not worry about that we simply need to tell the other settlements of her unfortunate mask leak and subsequent madness then she will stop being an issue. For now focus on reducing the damage as best you can. Over and out.
