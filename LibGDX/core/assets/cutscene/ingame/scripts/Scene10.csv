templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Who are you? Why are you here? I thought I was the only one stationed here.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,Ahh right yes of course . . . They . . . They did not tell you! I . . . Umm . . . I have been assigned to this village too! I am working towards a vaccine for the towns folk.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Interesting I assume they did not tell me because . . .
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor, I have got nothing I do not know why they would not tell me. How much progress have you made with this vaccine of yours?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,I would be further along if that crazy witch was not trying to hinder me at every step. All she does is steal my things.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,SHE CANNOT EVEN USE THEM! WHY DOES SHE NEED POTASSIUM? What is she doing with it!? Nothing! Shes lost her damn mind.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,She did mention some interesting things about the Order.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,All false of course.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Of course. I am more interested in what you have been saying.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,What?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Ahh nothing. Ignore me.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Bad Dude,So are you just going to sit there? Do you not have work to be doing?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Yeah I just have one patient to take care of here.
