templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Strange Man,Ahh you scared me there.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Who are you? Why are you here? I thought I was the only Doctor stationed here.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Strange Man,Ahh right yes of course... They... They did not tell you! I... Umm... I have been assigned to this village too! I am working towards a vaccine for the towns folk.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Interesting I assume they did not tell me because...
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor, I have got nothing... I don't know why they wouldn't tell me. How much progress have you made with this vaccine of yours?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Questionable Man,I would be further along if that crazy witch wasn't trying to hinder me at every step. All she does is steal my things.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Questionable Man,SHE CANNOT EVEN USE THEM! WHY DOES SHE NEED POTASSIUM? What is she doing with it!? Nothing! Shes lost her damn mind.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,She did mention some interesting things about the Order.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Questionable Man,All false of course.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Of course. I am more interested in what you have been saying.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Evil Man,What?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Ahh nothing. Ignore me.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Evil Man,So are you just going to sit there? Do you not have work to be doing?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Yeah I just have one patient to take care of here.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Objective,You know what to do.
