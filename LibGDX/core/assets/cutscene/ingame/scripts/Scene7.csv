templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,You investigate the church and find Sylvia.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Dr Sylvia?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,You! How did you find me? Stay away! I will hurt you if you come anywhere near me
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,I know what you bastards have been doing. How did you think you could get away with it?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,Calm down! I am not here to cause you any harm. I was sent here after you disappeared to clean up the mess you left.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,I have been ordered to bring you back so we can take care of you. I read your journal and we think you may be infected. The Order will be glad to know you are still alive.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,I am assuming they asked you to bring me in? To get me to talk? Said they would look after me? That I was crazy? They told you to find me for my own good? Bullshit!
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,Assuming what you have just said is not a lie. Let me tell you something. They are just using you for their ends. I saw them. They're here and they are after me.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,If you are not careful they will come for you too. They are watching. Little eyes all around. They will not stop.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,When did you start experiencing symptoms?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,Did you listen to me just now? They are coming! They will know I am here. I suggest you stop being their dog and look around for yourself. I am not crazy.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Plague Doctor,What is that supposed to mean?
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,Sylvia,That is all I'm telling you.
templateCutsceneSpeaker.png,,Sylvia runs away from the church.
